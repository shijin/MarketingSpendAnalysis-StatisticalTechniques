Marketing Spend Effectiveness Analysis Using Statistical Technqiues

Overview

This project analyzes marketing campaign performance using two key metrics:

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**
- **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)**

By applying statistical techniques such as **log transformation**, **empirical rule**, **outlier detection using z-scores**, **confidence intervals**, and **hypothesis testing**, the project uncovers important patterns and validates assumptions that can aid marketing optimization.

---

Objective

- Explore the distribution of CTR and CPA.
- Apply log transformation to reduce skewness.
- Identify outliers using z-score and the empirical rule.
- Estimate confidence intervals for the mean of CTR and CPA.
- Conduct hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.
